struct employeeWages {
    
    create structure to hold objects for employee name, pay rate, hours worked, tax rate, net pay and gross pay
 
};

int main () {
    
    declare variable using employeeWage structure and a variable to hold tax withholdings
    
    prompt user to enter name
    user inputs name
    
    prompt user to input pay rate
    user inputs pay rate
    
    prompt user to input hours worked
    input hours worked
    
    Use formulas to figure out tax withholdings
    tax withholdings = flat tax rate * employee pay rate * employee hours worked
    gross pay = employee hours * employee pay rate
    net pay = gross pay - taxwitholdings
    
    output employee pay card information
    employee name
    employee hours
    employee pay rate
    employee gross pay
    employee net pay
}
